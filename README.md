# SymPGSolver


SymPGSolver (Symbolic Parity Games Solver) is a tool that  implements a collection of procedures to generate and 
solve symbolic parity games, as well as compare the performance of different symbolic algorithms.
SymPGSolver is implemented in C++ language and uses the CUDD package by Fabio Somenzi as the underlying BDD and ADD libraries.

SymPGSolver implements the following symbolic algorithms:

- RE : recursive (Zielonka) algorithm 

- APT: APT algorithm : (https://www.academia.edu/24763192/Solving_Parity_Games_Using_An_Automata-Based_Algorithm) 

- SPM :symbolic small progress measures algorithm (https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~ornak/publications/stacs04.pdf)

- SSPM: set-based symbolic small progress measures algorithm (http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2017/7683/pdf/LIPIcs-CSL-2017-18.pdf)

BUILD AND INSTALLATION


 1 - Install the CUDD package in "sympgsolver/cudd" folder following the procedure in https://github.com/ivmai/cudd

 2 - Edit the file "Makefile" in the folrder "sympgsolver/bin" replacing the path "/path/to/cudd-3.0.0" with the right path.

 3 - Compile with "make" by command line.

EXECUTION

1 - Run benchmarks over random games with linear structure:

A random game with linear structure is built by restricting the transition relation as follows: a node v_i can make a transition to node v_j , where 0 <= i, j <= |P| − 1 (with P set of nodes), if and only if |i − j| <= d, where d is named as the distance parameter.

    ./sympgsolver benchmarks random [nodes] [priorities] [distance] [num.executions] [list algorithms to compare: RE;APT;SPM;SSPM]
   
 Examples:
    
     ./sympgsolver benchmarks random 1000 5 25 100 RE APT SPM SSPM
     ./sympgsolver benchmarks random 2000 10 100 100 RE APT

2 - Run benchmarks over a specific game saved in a file .pm

     ./sympgsolver benchmark file [priorities][num.executions] [list algorithms to compare: RE;APT;SPM;SSPM]
    
 Examples:
 
     ./sympgsolver file ladder.pm 1000 2 1000 SPM SSPM
     ./sympgsolver file clique.pm 1000 1000 SPM SSPM
     
  In the following you cand find the links for two folders containing the ladder games and clique games generated by PGSolver:
  - ladder games: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-EHxBiKnSQCNUpsRVQ4VjVFU0k/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-IUfTg8GUiGTPHyZVog3TTQ
  - clique games: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-EHxBiKnSQCeF9peWdqM0pFNjg/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-DDscENz4jI-sMvFLUrd_xQ
     
3 - Solve a symbolic parity game generated randomly 

     ./sympgsolver solver [algorithm] [nodes] [priorities] [distance] 
     
  Example:
  
      ./sympgsolver solver RE 1200 5 25
